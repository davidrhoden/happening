Crown Royal
David: "On this one, we had to implement the whims of a rogue creative director who eventually got fired. He actually wanted the whole site background to look like moving, flowing liquor. He had a lot of crazy requests that the client loved, and we managed to implement most of them. It's such a ridiculous, tacky site, but I kind of love it."

Kid Rock for Devil's Cut Bourbon
David: "This was a challenging but silly and fun job. What I ad to do was set up a page that would automatically style Kid Rock's Tweets regardless of how long or short they were. I had to do this with Cufón, a sIFR alternative I hadn't worked with before. (I had worked with sIFR some, and that was no fun either.)
Tech: CSS/HTML, Cufón, Flash, Photoshop, Jenkins
